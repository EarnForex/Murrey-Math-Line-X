# Murrey Math Line X

Murrey Math Line X is a custom pivot point indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by Vladislav Goshkov and is based on Murrey Math rules. It shows important support, resistance, and pivot levels.

The indicator can be used to build Murrey Math lines based on the current chart's candles and based on some upper timeframe (set via input parameters).

It can also issue alerts when a line is crossed.
